# A comparative evaluation of Bayesian and Logistic regression models in estimating risk of hypertension in the Kenyan population– using multilevel STEPs survey data

Hypertension is a leading contributor to the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs)
in Kenya, with a prevalence exceeding 20% among adults. While identifying risk factors
is crucial for public health intervention, epidemiological studies often rely on standard lo
gistic regression. Under logistic regression, the ORs are non-collapsible and overestimate
true Risk Ratios(RRs) when the outcome is common. They do not recover marginal
or cluster-specific RRs even with covariate adjustment, making interpretation difficult
and potentially misleading for policy decisions. This study aims to estimate population
averaged RR and cluster-specific RR which are more relevant for policy decisions and
reflects household context respectively. Using data from the 2015 Kenya WHO STEPwise
approach to NCD risk factor surveillance (STEPs) survey, this study will fit and compare single-level and multilevel models under both frequentist and Bayesian frameworks.
The analysis will explicitly incorporate complex survey design elements, including stratification, clustering, and sampling weights, to ensure population-representative inference.
Furthermore, the study will address measurement error inherent in composite hypertension definitions through probabilistic bias analysis and outcome sensitivity checks. Model
performance will be rigorously evaluated using cluster-aware cross-validation metrics, in
cluding the Expected Log Predictive Density (ELPD) and Brier scores, alongside comparison of posterior credible intervals against frequentist confidence intervals. We hypothesize that Bayesian multilevel models, when implemented with design-consistent inference and
transparent prior specification can improve uncertainty quantification and hierarchical
inference relative to single-level logistic models. This study will provide methodologically
sound insights into associations with hypertension as defined in WHO STEPs, and will
explicitly evaluate the robustness of findings to detection and treatment–related classifi
cation using prespecified sensitivity analyses and bias modeling. These insights to guide
the Kenyan Ministry of Health in tailoring context-specific NCD prevention and control
strategies.
